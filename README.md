# GameNet

This project aims at developing neural network for end-to-end training, i.e. the network will get whole image as input and the output will be desired sensor values (acceleration, speed, direction, etc).
Since it is difficult to obtain dataset with these sensor values from real vehicle, and it is even more difficult to run multiple tests on actual road; we will be using games with high graphics quality to do analyze our network performace.

There are multiple goals of this project:

1. Train a network in surpvised manner and show that scene parsing is NOT the only solution for self-driving vehicles.
2. Use unsupervised technique to build a representation and then show that less data is sufficient enough for supervised training of network after this point.
3. Build our own metric to show that after certain point GFlops pose more significance than accuracy (IoU/iIoU).

List of games that we will be using in this project are:
+ [Grand Theft Auto V](http://www.rockstargames.com/V/)
+ games preferably with high graphics quality and driving assistance feature

Project members are: Abhishek Chaurasia, Eugenio Culurciello, Karan Dwivedi, and Xinrui Wang.

First use [utility](utils) folder to interface your system with any game and then prepare dataset compatible for GameNet.
Next, go to [train](train) folder to train your  neural network.

Getting image of first frame:
```
def show_image_read_from_hdf5_file(img):
    from skimage.viewer import ImageViewer
    img = np.array(img, dtype='u1')
    img = img.transpose((1, 2, 0))
    img = img[:, :, ::-1]
    viewer = ImageViewer(img.reshape(SIZE, SIZE, 3))
    viewer.show()

#Metadata (non-pixel data) in the “targets” hdf5 dataset:
#Spin (yaw velocity)
#Direction (1 for left spin, -1 for right spin)
#Speed (velocity in the forward direction of the car, negative velocity represents going in reverse)
#Speed change (change in the above value)
#Steering (steering angle from 1 to -1, right to left, zero is straight ahead)
#Throttle (gas pedal position from 0 to 1)
```

## Enviroment Setup
### 1. Purchase [GTA-V](http://www.rockstargames.com/V/)
### 2. Game Setup
* Update GTAV to the last version 

* Copy-paste the contents of *bin/Release* under your GTAV installation directory 

* Replace your saved game data in *Documents/Rockstar Games/GTA V/Profiles/* with the contents contents of *bin/SaveGame*. 

* Download *[paths.xml](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bzh5djJlCOmMOTA1RVlOXzZ5dEk)* and store it also in the GTAV installation directory. 
### 3. Game Configuration
* Configure your setup in the *config.ini* file
* **mode:** 0 for dataset generation, 1 for reinforcement learning [integer]
* **imageWidth:** Width in pixels of the images generated by the plugin [integer]
* **imageHeight:** Height in pixels of the images generated by the plugin [integer]
* **car:** Vehicle to use. For now only blista (Toyota Prius) is supported (0) [integer]
* **weatherChangeDelay:** Time in seconds between weather changes [integer]
* **initialWeather:** Initial weather type [integer]
* **initialHour:** Initial in-game hour [integer]
* **initialMinute:** Initial in-game minute [integer]
* **initialPosX:** Initial x position of the vehicle (will be redefined to closest road) [integer]
* **initialPosY:** Initial y position of the vehicle (will be redefined to closest road) [integer]
* **maxDuration:** Duration in hours of the session [integer]

See *Scenario.cpp* for more details on the supported values, especially for car, drivingStyle and initialWeather.
#### 3.1. Dataset generation description
The in-game screenshots are stored as RGB PNG format, with the specified width and length of the *config.ini* file. These images are named in order of capture from 1 to undefined. Alongside the images, a file named *dataset.txt* contains a row for each image name, with the labels associated to it separated by spaces. The labels are the following, in the same order:

* Speed (m/s)
* Acceleration (m/s2)
* Brake pedal position (0 to 1)
* Steering angle (-1 to 1, left to right)
* Throttle pedal position (-1 to 1, negative is reverse)
* Yaw rate (deg/s)
* Direction (-1 to left, 1 to right)
* **captureFreq:** Frequency of image and labels capture in Hz (FPS) [integer]
* **datasetDir:** Absolute path with trailing slash to directory to save the dataset (must exist) [string]
* **setSpeed:** Set speed of the vehicle in m/s during dataset generation [float]
* **drivingStyle:** Driving style of the vehicle driver during dataset generation, -1 is manual mode [integer]

#### 3.2. Reinforcement learning description
* **reward:** Selection of reward function [integer]
* **desiredSpeed:** For rewards that require so, the set speed the vehicle should have (m/s) [float]
* **desiredAgressivity:** For rewards that require so, a float between 0 and 1 that regulates the behavior of the reward function [float]
* **host:** IP to connect to [string]
* **port:** Port to connect to [integer]

3 type of reward functions can be chosen, all of them penalize collisions:
* **Reach speed (0):** Reach and keep a desired speed.
* **Stay in lane (1):** The more centered the better, if the vehicle goes against traffic or gets out of the road the reward will be negative.
* **General (2):** It is a combination of the other two, the vehicle will try to stay in lane while maintaining a certain speed, the agressivity configuration option sets how the two partial rewards are averaged. The more agressivity the more reward will be given for keeping the speed and less to stay in lane (i.e. tendence to overtake other vehicles)
